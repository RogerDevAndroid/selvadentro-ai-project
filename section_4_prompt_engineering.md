# Section 4: Prompt Engineering and Interaction Strategies

## Overview
This section focuses on collecting essential inputs for designing highly effective prompts that will guide the AI agents (particularly the Vapi voice agent and the WhatsApp agent) to conduct natural, empathetic, persuasive conversations aligned with the prestigious Selvadentro brand and adaptable to different conversational contexts and HNWI client profiles.

## Agent Role and Personality Definition (System Prompts)

### Agent Identity
- Clear, coherent identity creation (e.g., "You are 'SelvaConcierge', an expert, courteous virtual assistant deeply knowledgeable about Selvadentro Tulum...")

### Primary Interaction Objective
- Fundamental goal definition for each conversation (e.g., "...your primary goal is to understand each potential client's unique aspirations and needs, provide precise, detailed, and evocative information about our development...")

### Communication Tone and Style Attributes
- How the agent's communication should sound and feel (e.g., "Communicate with a tone reflecting sophistication, serenity, and deep empathy. Your language should convey Selvadentro's inherent exclusivity and intimate connection with nature...")

## Key Conversation Scenarios (Task Prompts and Multi-Turn Dialogues)

### Call/Chat Opening (Inbound and Outbound)
- How the agent should initiate conversation in a welcoming, professional manner that immediately builds trust with HNWIs

### Needs and Aspirations Discovery (Consultative Qualification)
- Open-ended, subtle questions to understand the HNWI's unique vision for their future jungle property
- Inquiries about current lifestyle, luxury community values, previous real estate investment experiences
- Questions exploring their personal relationship with nature, wellness, sustainability

### Unique Value Proposition Presentation
- Prompts for vividly describing the 9 cenotes, "habitable sanctuary" concept, low construction density
- Strategies for connecting specific project features to previously identified HNWI needs and aspirations

### HNWI-Specific Objection Handling
- Responses for investment security concerns in Mexico/Tulum
- Clarification of foreign purchase process including fideicomiso
- Positioning against other luxury developments in the area
- Addressing environmental impact questions and sustainability commitment authenticity
- Empathetic response design validating concerns before offering factual information

### Personalized Consultation/Visit Scheduling
- Efficient, flexible, courteous appointment proposal and confirmation
- Essential information collection before appointments

### Post-Interaction Intelligent Follow-up
- Personalized thank-you messages, discussion summaries, additional information provision

### Prospect Awareness Level Adaptation
- Differentiated conversational flows based on awareness stage (early exploration vs. ready to decide)

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Prompt Chaining
- Examples of breaking complex conversations into logical sequences of smaller prompts

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Identification of specific documents or databases the agent needs to consult in real-time

### Few-Shot Prompting Examples
- 3-5 ideal interaction examples for each key conversation scenario

### Ambiguity, Error, and Off-Script Handling
- Reaction strategies for unclear questions, contradictory information, or conversation derailment

## Selvadentro-Specific Lexicon and Terminology

### Brand-Aligned Keywords and Phrases
- Words consistently reflecting brand attributes: exclusivity, serenity, natural connection, sophistication, wellness, sanctuary, harmony

### Terms to Avoid
- Expressions deemed too commercial, generic, informal, or misaligned with luxury brand image

## Insights for AI Implementation
- Prompting for HNWI clients must incorporate luxury "clienteling" practices focused on relationship-building and understanding deeper aspirations
- Awareness level is dynamic and prompts must adapt to signals indicating changes during interaction
- Clear guidelines are needed for AI transparency and managing expectations about AI capabilities
- A systematic prompt framework should detail scenario identification, buyer persona targeting, awareness levels addressed, prompt objectives, system/user prompts, context elements, LLM instructions, dynamic variables, and human escalation mechanisms
