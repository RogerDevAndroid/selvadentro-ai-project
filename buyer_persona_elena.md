## Current Lifestyle & Aspirations
Elena leads a fast-paced, purpose-driven life split between a modern urban home in Munich and frequent international travel for her sustainable technology business and philanthropic initiatives. While successful and fulfilled professionally, she increasingly feels disconnected from nature and seeks more meaningful experiences away from digital overwhelm.

## Relationship with Nature & Luxury
For Elena, true luxury is defined by experiences, quality time, and spaces that inspire mindfulness and respect for the environment. She views nature as essential to her family's wellbeing and balance, seeking immersive natural settings rather than manufactured experiences.
