# Section 5: KPIs and Ethical Considerations

## Overview
This section defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) to objectively and continuously measure the success and effectiveness of the implemented AI agents. It also addresses fundamental ethical considerations to ensure the implementation protects sensitive client information (especially HNWIs) and maintains Selvadentro's brand trust and integrity.

- Total appointments successfully scheduled by AI agents
- Attendance rate for AI-scheduled appointments
- Average time from first contact to appointment scheduling via AI
- Time reduction for human advisors on scheduling tasks

### Sales Impact (Direct and Indirect)
- Sales pipeline value generated or significantly influenced by AI agent interactions

## Insights for Implementation
- In luxury real estate, AI success measurement goes beyond lead counting to include interaction quality and exclusivity perception
- Qualitative feedback systems are needed to capture subtle but crucial perceptions
- The auditor agent can play a key role in ongoing quality control and ethical refinement
- Success definition must align with the primary goal of making AI agents the main sales revenue channel
- A lead tracking system throughout the entire sales cycle is needed to attribute AI impact on sales conversion
